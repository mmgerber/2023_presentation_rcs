## The Study

- Police legitimacy

## The rolling cross-section design (RCS)

- **Cross-section**: data obtained at a specific point in time
    - Limited to correlational research
- Causal inference needs to consider time as a factor (Kenski et al., 2010)
- RCS distributes interviewing within a cross-section in a controlled (**random**) way over time (Johnston & Brady 2002; Kenski et al., 2010)
    - Total sample is divided into multiple **replicates** (smaller random samples)
    - Replicates are assigned to be interviewed at different intervals of times

::: notes
- Smaller intervals: more sensitive to change in the environment but require more management costs 
- New replicate introduced into the field before an older replicate is exhausted - overlap betwen subsamples 
- Once the first round of replicates have been completed, any given day will be composed of approximately the samel percentaje of first/second/third-call-attempt numbers.
- Data collected at the beginning of the survey should be used with caution as they may contain higher % of first-time-call attempts
- Number of replicates depend on sample size goals and response rates
- It's possible to release more replicates around time of particular interest
- All replicates should be treated in the same way (consistent schedule, same nr. of re-contacting)

### Advantages
- Temporal heterogeneity: Time as an opportunity
- Can capture naturally-occuring expected and unexpected events
- Avoids missatributing effects to the wrong events (if intervals are small)
- Flexibility: information can be divided into different time periods for analysis
- Data can be analised as single cross-section, repeated cross-section or aggregated into time series
- If individuals are only interviewed once, there should be little conditioning of participant responses

### Disadvantages
- Not able to capture individual change
- Small sample size to study individual days
- Response rates may be lower do to strict protocols to release samples

:::




::: notes
- When populations are studied across an extended period of time, it is assumed that no meaningful variation will take place within the sampling period. 
- RCS takes advantage of temporal heterogeneity, it's converted into an object of study
- While experiments are considered the best method for establishing causality, they do not consider realistic approaches 
- Low sample sizes mean high sampling error. Method to alleviate problem is smoothing out the data lines with moving averages, pooling data across days. Noise from sampling error is reduced by capitalising on samples from nearby days (moving averages). However, when data is shifting, mixing values together from different days can mask the shift. Also, centered moving average will reflect a change before the change has actually occurred in the population.

- RCS design first introduced in the 1984 American National Election Study
    - Capture effects of different campaing events (e.g., conventions)

## The rolling cross-section design (RCS) in the context of a panel design

- **Panel studies**: individuals are interviewed at two or more points in time  
    - Generally better than cross-sectional designs for causal inference (Kenski et al., 2010)
    - Possible to make inferences about changes in attitudes or behaviours at the individual level (RCS by itself is not able to capture change)

::: notes
- Disadvantage of panel studies: expensive, mortality makes the study less generalizable.
- Repeated interviewing may sensitize individuals to the concepts and methods of the study
- Towards the end of an RCS study, new data may not be useful. Researcher wants to have each interval of time containing data with similar proportions of cases derived from first/second/third call attempts (same with beginning of RCS)
