::: notes
- Panel studies cannot examine short-term variability of events, since time intervals between waves are usually much larger
- RCS spread a conventional cross-sectional design over a certain period of time, distributing the interviews in a strictly controlled way.
- RCS have been utilised to study the effect of electoral campaigns on voting attitudes and behaviours
- RCS by itself cannot study change in individuals

## 'Unexpected event during survey' design

> "research design that exploits the occurrence of an unexpected event during the fieldwork of a public opinion survey to estimate its causal effect on a relevant outcome by comparing responses of the individuals interviewed before the event $t_i<t_e$ (control group) to those of respondents interviewed after the event $t_i>t_e$ (treatment group)." (Muñoz et al., 2020, p. 187)

- **Quasi-experiment**: Effects of **naturally occurring** events that cannot be manipulated through controlled experiments 
- Assumption that **interview time** is **independent** from the time when the **event** occurs

::: notes
- Higher external validity
- While experiments are considered the best method for establishing causality, they do not consider realistic approaches

## The RCS design

### An 'expected-unexpected' event during survey design

> "the design is just a standard cross-section, but the day on which a respondent is interviewed is chosen randomly" (Johnston & Brady, 2022, p. 283)

> "The data collected in an RCS allow a fine-grained analysis of dynamic phenomena of public opinion" (Lutz et al., 2013, p. 3)

- Temporal heterogeneity as an opportunity to move closer to **causal inference** (Johnston & Brady, 2002)


::: notes
Some advantages:
- RCS takes advantage of temporal heterogeneity, it's converted into an object of study
- Avoids missatributing effects to the wrong events
- Flexibility: information can be divided into different time periods for analysis
- Little conditioning of participant responses

Some disadvantages:
- Not able to capture individual change
- Small sample size to study individual days
- Response rates may be lower do to strict protocols to release samples
- Towards the end of an RCS study, new data may not be useful. Researcher wants to have each interval of time containing data with similar proportions of cases derived from first/second/third call attempts (same with beginning of RCS)

## The RCS design
### The 'expected-unexpected' event during survey design
<br>
**Steps** (Kenski et al., 2010):

1. Total **number of interviews** is established
2. Full sample is **randomly divided** into multiple **replicates**
3. Replicates assigned to be interviewed at **different intervals of times**
4. The same **protocol** is followed for all replicates

## The RCS design

::: notes
- Analyze how the public reacts to the International Women's Day in Spain 2019. 
- Nationally representative telephone survey based on a RCS design through a daily tracking over 20 total days, before and after the protest day. Between 100 and 120 interviews were conducted each day
- Respondents were divided into two groups, treated and not treated.
- Findings confirm that such hybrid media protest can broaden their audience, generate interest, spark conversations on gender inequality and contribute to opinion conformation.

## The RCS design
### Assumptions
<br>
1. **Temporal ignorability**: Moment of the interview should be as *good as random*

2. **Excludability**: Timing of the interview $t$ affects $Y$ only through event $T$

3. **Compliance**: assignment to the treatment ($t_i>t_e$) corresponds to actually receiving treatment ($T=1$)

::: notes
1. **Temporal ignorability**: "for any individual, the potential outcomes must be independent from the moment of the interview" (Muñoz et al., p. 189)
  - Moment of the interview should be as *good as random*
  - In RCS moment of interview *is* random
  - Protocol to ensure equal procedures to contact and recontact sample units
  - Need to compare 'treated' and 'not-treated' in terms of ease of contact and socio-demographics (Lutz et al., 2013)

- Assumptions under which unexpected events can yield valid causal estimates
- Assignment to different values of time t should be independent from the potential outcomes of Y. 
- The daily samples need to fulfill two compelling properties: (1) They must consist of a somewhat stable mix of respondents that are easy and such that are harder to reach. (2) The socio-demographic characteristics of their members must not vary significantly over the course of the campaign.(Lutz et al., 2013)
- Threats often arise from complex sampling designs. Primary sampling units are often contacted and interviewed sequentially. For example, in face-to-face surveys the fieldwork often follows a geographical pattern for efficiency reasons. 
- **Reachability**: ease of contact and reluctance to participate can vary between respondents. In ESS there is a relationship between number of attempted contacts and how late they are interviewed during fieldwork. Therefore, the subjects who are more elusive and harder to reach will have a higher probability of being interviewed after any unexpected event. If reachability is correlated with the potential outcomes, its correlation with treatment assignment will bias the estimates of the causal effect. As expected, those who were older, less educated, and out of the labor market were interviewed earlier during the fieldwork of the ESS survey. This happened less so in RCS designs. 
  - Should be less of a concern in RCS because day is random. If days overlap, in the long term the design should lead to equal numbers of first/second/third time respondents (Johnston and Brady, 2002).  
- **Attrition**: Troublesome if nonresponse is triggered by the treatment. Being exposed to certain events might lead people to refrain from answering some questions or altogether. 

2. **Excludability**: "any difference between respondents interviewed before and after the event shall be the sole consequence of the event" (Muñoz et al., p. 189)
  - Timing of the interview $t$ affects $Y$ only through event $T$
  - Beware of collateral events, simultaneous events and unrelated time trends
  - Need to characterize the event and its reactions

- The excludability assumption will be violated if the decision about the moment when the event occurs is endogenous to the outcome variable Y. 
- **Collateral events**: succession of reactions triggered by the unexpected event of interest. E.g. reactions to a terrorist attack might drive public opinion's response. Should be interpreted as the joint effect of the envent and the subsequent reactions
- **Simultaneous events**: unrelated events that take place at the same time. Problem of compound treatments. Assumption that out of all the treatments that covary with the timing of the interview, the events of interest is the only treatment that affects the potential outcomes.
- **Unrelated time trends**: presence of time-varying variables that, aside from the event itself, are systematically related to the outcome (temporal stability assumption). E.g. calendar effects

3. **Compliance**: "Assignment to the treatment group $t_i>t_e$ was assumed to perfectly correspond to actually receiving treatment $T=1$." (Muñoz et al., 2020, p. 194)
  - Need to measure compliance

- Some of the subjects were not really exposed to the event

## This Study
### Police legitimacy
<br>

- Police work requires public support to be able to function in a democratic context

- Beliefs that the police act in **procedurally just** ways and are **legitimate** facilitate compliance and cooperation with authorities

- A socially legitimate police force should require little violence to confront opposition

- However, the world has seen many cases of **violent demonstrations**, **police violence** and **human rights violations**

## This Study
### The Chilean case
<br>

- Chile's main police force, the Carabineros, was among the most trusted institutions (Dammert, 2019)

- Yet, recent **events of corruption** and **excessive use of force** during the social uprising in October 2019 have produced a serious loss of trust (Gerber et al., 2023)

- **Crisis of legitimacy**: proposals of "deep reform" and even the dissolution of the institution

- Need to understand relationship between police and citizens in Chile during the next crucial years

## This Study
### Aims
<br>

- **Confirmatory**: 
  - Track over time people's perceived police legitimacy and motivational postures towards the police, and examine their relationships with perceived procedural justice and fear of the police in Chile

- **Exploratory**: 
  - Determine the effects of potential unexpected events (such as police violence, corruption scandals or reforms) on perceptions of legitimacy, procedural justice and fear of the police in Chile.

## This Study 
### A RCS panel design
<br>

- **Probability-based online panel** of the population in Chile (18-65 years old)

- Panel study with **10 waves**

- Face-to-face recruitment with probability-based sampling design

- **Sample size**
  - Expected sample in contact survey: n = 5,300 
  - Expected sample in Wave 1: n = 1,500 

- Possibility to combine with non-probabilistic sample to increase sample size

## Contribution of the RCS panel design

- Facilitates the **causal identification** of **unexpected events**
  - During waves
  - Between waves

- Potential to identify interactions between
  - Unexpected events *within* and *between* waves
  - Unexpected events with main study hypotheses

::: notes
- How many interviews? Given by funding
- Over how many days? 5 weeks to leave window for detecting unexpected events, but still having separate waves
- What is the recommended bandwidth/interval? Smaller intervals (day) are more sensitive to change but requiere more management costs
- How long should we keep interview open?
  - New replicate introduced into the field before an older replicate is exhausted - overlap betwen subsamples 
  - Once the first round of replicates have been completed, any given day will be composed of approximately the samel percentaje of first/second/third-call-attempt numbers.
  - Data collected at the beginning of the survey should be used with caution as they may contain higher % of first-time-call attempts
